# Low_pipeline_conversion_analysis
TechnoServe is a SaaS provider, its revenue is highly dependent on the number of clients. However, the company faces a pertinent problem that is prevalent in the IT industry today: declining conversions across its sales funnel. This means the company is failing to convert its potential customers into clients. The companyâ€™s sales pipeline conversion percentage has dropped from 35% at the end of the last fiscal (FY 2017-18) to 25% at present. 

To solve TechnoServe's low pipeline conversion issue,  I tried to Understand the problem using 5W &amp; SPIN framework, suggested 4P hypothesis, created issue tree model, analysed the given dataset using Pivot table , pivot chart &amp; found out all the probable root causes &amp; generated all the key insights & presented the issues & probable solution using Pyramid Principle.
